## About

This application includes a basic WebSocket server that facilitates communication with a Q-SYS core for control purposes. Recent versions of Q-SYS support communication with the core using the WebSocket protocol. This adapter utilizes TCP/IP on the backend, enabling the frontend to connect and communicate via the Python WebSocket server.
